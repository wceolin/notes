Dear reader from the future,

I'm writing this letter 4.54 billion years after Earth was formed. I don't know if you're trying to rebuild our planet or just visiting us from outer space. But I'd like to apologize because my generation was one of the ones responsible for destroying this beautiful planet. We've created something called nationalism - and that was our downfall.

We've created imaginary lines to divide our planet into several portions of land that we call _countries_ or _nations_. Each one of those countries was governed by what we called _politicians_. They can be _kings_, _presidents_, _prime-ministers_, _governors_, _chancelors_, among other names we give them - it doesn't actually matter. The most important thing to understand is that those people had the power to decide the future of their portion of land - and, in order to gain more power, they've convinced people living in their land that they were better than others.

110 years before I wrote this letter, our planet had a 4-year war that we initially called _The Great War_. It was later renamed _World War I_ because the increasing nationalism in the coming decades resulted in an even greater war - now known as _World War II_. Millions of people were killed because of a movement called _fascism_. It was movement advocating for extreme nationalism that relied on propaganda to spread fear among the population and reach power. They used those imaginary borders to create imaginary enemies, then they used the fear of those enemies to control the population of their portions of land, using them to fight people from other portions of land.

When I was a kid, I couldn't understand how people let it happen. I came to the conclusion it was the lack of information and, therefore, that wouldn't happen anymore now that our society is connected through a network of computers that we call the _internet_ - even though movies like _Die Welle_ tried to warn us that fascism could happen again.

A portion of land called _The United States of America_ created nuclear weapons during World War II and they used to kill hundreds of thousands of people in another portion of land called _Japan_, even though the fascists had already been defeated and the war was basically over. The "Father of the Atomic Bomb", Robert Oppenheimer, is quoted saying "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds," a a line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita.

He was right.

As I write this letter - 79 years after the end of World War II - I fear that we will not escape our own destruction, either by portions of land using nuclear weapons against other portion of lands or by emitting so much toxic gases into our atmosphere that we will turn our planet into that red planet nearby, making it unsuitable for life for another few billion years.

Remember that technology called _internet_ that I told you about earlier? It turns out it was used to manipulate people into hating each other - the same thing that had happened 100 years earlier. The world was becoming more united after World War II. We created an association of planets called UN (United Nations). European countries that used to fight each other now created the EU (European Union), promoting free market and movement in the region. Globalism became strong. We started helping each other instead of fighting each other. We were on the path to becoming one united planet. But it all started to end around 10 years ago.

We used the internet to create something called _social media_. It was a great idea: It would help to connect people around the world, making us closer together, embracing diversity. It did happen for a while. However, we had something called _money_. It allowed people to exchange work for a piece of paper (later replaced by digital coins). We measured success by how much _money_ a person was able to accumulate. People would create a _business_ to provide services and accumulate more money. Those social media platforms were part of this business thing.

The longer a person stayed on social media, the more money that business would accumulate because they were paid by other businesses to show their products to those people there. Therefore, social media companies realized that they needed to keep people on their platforms as much as possible. That would help them accumulate more money. There was one problem, though: When people saw something they don't like, they would leave. In order to keep people reading social media, they've decided to show more content that would make people stay on the platform. This made hateful content grow worldwide.

People started hating people who looked different - or even hating people for loving another person of the same gender. They were convinced that their love was destroying their families. They started claiming they couldn't get more pieces of paper (money) because other people (called _immigrants_) were invading their portions of land (nation).

Some people believed that an entity called _God_ created the universe but they diverged on who this _God_ was. Some people believed in one god, others believed in multiple. Some thought that _God_ sent their representative to Earth. They called those representatives _prophets_. Then, the confusion became even bigger because different people would believe in different prophets and harm people because of their beliefs.

By this point, fascism was growing again. They used social media to make people hate each other, to end globalism and open borders. Nationalism was growing even faster than it was 100 years ago. Many people would say that the first sign was when the _United Kingdom_ left the European Union eight years ago. Probably they were right. There were other signs over the past years: More portions of the land started using the nationalist rhetoric. The _United States of America_ using the "America first" and "Make America great again" slogans; German parties started saying "Germany for germans"; Brazil saying "Brazil above everything, God above all"; both Brazil and Italy using the "God, Homeland, Family" slogans.

Then, when a global pandemic came, those same politicians used social media to tell people not to get vaccinated. They started creating conspiracy theories about science saying that vaccines were killing people and that climate change (how we were poisoning our planet) wasn't real. The signs were there, we just ignored them - or we didn't know how to fight back.

Overall, I might agree that all that happened in the coming decades started when the _United Kingdom_ left the _European Union_. But, deep down, I always thought things would change. I thought those things were fascism's last breath. I no longer believe it. I now think that we've reached a point of no return. I'm writing this the day fascism is taking over the European Parliament. I think in the future people will see this day as the beginning of the end.

Nationalism will grow in the coming years. Economic crises due to technological automation will make those portions of land close their borders even further in the coming decades. People who today say they're in favor of a _free market_ will ironically end the global free market. I feel hopeless and powerless. I don't think there's anything we can do to stop nationalism and the comeback of fascism. We forgot that we all share the same planet, the same cells, the same blood. In a moment in history when we needed a united planet we became more divided than ever. Unfortunately, this is leading to _World War III_ - and that will be the downfall of our civilization.

To whoever is reading this letter in the future: I hope you forgive us. We don't know what we're doing.
